Prototype Game for a larger project i consider programming in the future, similar to mini motorways

Principles:
A world made up of ground, water, and mountain tiles is generated
In this world, small cities start generating slowly
The player has to connect these cities with a efficient road network.
Cars randomly spawn in cities and want to go to another cities. Cars can not go through cities,
making this a game where a player essentially manages a highway network. 
The roads can be upgraded to accommodate more cars at once.
The game ends when the road network is clogged up or if the player runs out of money.


Othe (more complex) game idea:
no cities, but houses
more detailed road system, allowing some classic highway interchanges
animated cars

PERFORMANCE:
zooming and pygame.draw seem to be not that performance killing. (but use less than 2000 times per frame)
Idea: put houses etc on surfaces mad before starting and blit that on the screen (use less than 5000 times per frame)
COLOR STANDARDS:
